Contributions are welcome in all areas related to homotopy type
theory, including but not limited to:

* Homotopical and higher-categorical semantics of type theory
* Synthetic homotopy theory
* Applications of univalence and higher inductive types
* Cubical type theories and cubical models
* Formalization of mathematics and computer science in homotopy type theory / univalent foundations

Please submit 1-paragraph abstracts through the EasyChair
conference system here:

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hott2019](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hott2019)

The submission deadline is **15 May 2019**; we expect to notify accepted
submissions by 1 June.

This conference is run on the "mathematics model" rather than the
"computer science model": full papers will not be submitted,
submissions will not be refereed, and submission is not a publication
(although a proceedings volume might be organized afterwards).  More
information, including registration, accomodation options, and travel,
will be available as the conference approaches on this web site.

Please email [hott2019conference@gmail.com](mailto:hott2019conference@gmail.com) with any questions.

##### Best Student Paper Award

A prize of $500 (and distinguished billing in the conference program)
will be awarded to the best paper submitted by a student (or recently
graduated student).  To be eligible for this prize, you must include
in your submission (or send separately to
[hott2019conference@gmail.com](mailto:hott2019conference@gmail.com)) a
link to a preprint version of your paper (e.g. on arXiv or a private
web space).
