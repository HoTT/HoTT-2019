Contributions are welcome in all areas related to homotopy type
theory, including but not limited to:

* Homotopical and higher-categorical semantics of type theory
* Synthetic homotopy theory
* Applications of univalence and higher inductive types
* Cubical type theories and cubical models
* Formalization of mathematics and computer science in homotopy type theory / univalent foundations

Please submit 1-paragraph abstracts through the EasyChair
conference system here:

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hott2019](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hott2019)

The submission deadline is **1 April 2019**; we expect to notify accepted
submissions by 1 May.  If you need an earlier decision for some reason
(e.g. to apply for funding), please submit your abstract by **15 March**
and send an email to hott2019conference@gmail.com notifying us that
you need an early decision.

This conference is run on the "mathematics model" rather than the
"computer science model": full papers will not be submitted,
submissions will not be refereed, and submission is not a publication
(although a proceedings volume might be organized afterwards).  More
information, including registration, accomodation options, and travel,
will be available as the conference approaches on this web site.

Please email [hott2019conference@gmail.com](mailto:hott2019conference@gmail.com) with any questions.
