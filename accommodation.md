To help with hotel accommodations, we have reserved a block of rooms at the
**Shadyside Inn All Suites Hotel**. The Shadyside Inn is not a regular hotel,
but a collection of furnished apartments in a cluster of buildings.  It is
located about 15-20 mins walk from the campus; you can also travel back and
forth using the Inn's shuttle service, or by bus. (Address: [5405 Fifth Ave,
Pittsburgh, PA, United States, 15232](https://maps.google.com/?q=5405+Fifth+Ave,+Pittsburgh,+PA,+United+States,+15232)).

The reserved accommodations are mostly in [two bedroom
suites](http://www.shadysideinn.com/hotel-suites/two-bedroom-suite/), at a rate
of $119/night + hotel taxes. These are spacious suites including a living room,
kitchen and dining area, two bedrooms and a bathroom. We assume that most of you
who choose these suites will want to share. If you already have a suite-mate to
share with, great; see below for instructions on how to make a shared
reservation. If you would like to find another participant to share with, please
send us an [email](mailto:hott2019conference@gmail.com) and we'll try to put you
in contact with another participant. In this case, one of you will have to make
the reservation and provide credit card information, but the payment can be made
separately after arriving or at checkout.
 
In addition, a limited number of studio suites are available for $99/night + 
hotel taxes. First come, first served.

to reserve a room for the conference (August 11-18).

Note that due to the nature of the interface provided by the Shadyside Inn, you
will have to make two separate bookings if you want to stay for the whole
duration including summer school and conference.
