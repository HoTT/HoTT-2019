To help with accommodation, we have negotiated special rates at two places:

* At the **Shadyside Inn All Suites Hotel** for both the summer school **and**
  the conference
* At the **Hotel Indigo** for the conference **only**

#### Shadyside Inn

The Shadyside Inn is not a regular hotel, but a collection of furnished
apartments in a cluster of buildings.  It is located about 20 mins walk from the
campus:

You can
also travel back and forth using the Inn's shuttle service, or by bus. (Address:
[5405 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, United States,
15232](https://maps.google.com/?q=5405+Fifth+Ave,+Pittsburgh,+PA,+United+States,+15232)).

The reserved accommodations are mostly in [two bedroom
suites](http://www.shadysideinn.com/hotel-suites/two-bedroom-suite/), at a rate
of $119/night + hotel taxes. These are spacious suites including a living room,
kitchen and dining area, two bedrooms and a bathroom. We assume that most of you
who choose these suites will want to share. If you already have a suite-mate to
share with, great; see below for instructions on how to make a shared
reservation. If you would like to find another participant to share with, you
can send us an 
[email](mailto:hott2019conference@gmail.com?subject=suite mate at Shadyside Inn) 
and we'll try to put
you in contact with another participant. In this case, one of you will have to
make the reservation and provide credit card information, but the payment can be
made separately after arriving or at checkout.
 
<!-- In addition, a limited number of studio suites are available for the 
conference (not the summer school) for $99/night + 
hotel taxes. First come, first served. -->

Click [here](http://www.shadysideinn.com/pro/cmu-philosophy-hott-summer-school/) 
to reserve a two bedroom suite for the summer school (August 6-11).

Click [here](http://www.shadysideinn.com/pro/cmu-international-conference-hott/)
to reserve a two bedroom suite for the conference (August 11-18).

In both cases you have to proceed by entering the appropriate dates in the upper
right corner of the page to access the offer at the reduced rate.
Note that due to the nature of the interface provided by the Shadyside Inn, you
will have to make two separate bookings if you want to stay for the whole
duration including summer school and conference.

#### Hotel Indigo

The [Hotel Indigo](https://www.indigopgh.com/) is a [45 minutes
walk](https://goo.gl/maps/zXnqpHVLuRQ2) from the conference location in a
neighborhood with good shopping, dining, and transport options, and provides a
complimentary shuttle service that can bring you to campus. Rooms are $119 +
taxes for single as well as some double rooms (two beds in the same room).
