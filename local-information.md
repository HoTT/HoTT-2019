### Getting around in Pittsburgh

The bus fare is paid on entering the bus and is $2.75 if you pay in cash (there is no change). If you need to change the bus to get somewhere, you have to pay again. It is possible to get a bus card and load it using a credit card at bus stations (â‰  bus stop). A bus station in Shadyside is [Negley station](https://www.google.de/maps/place/East+Busway+at+Negley+Station+D/@40.4539493,-79.9350931,16.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8834f212ef940167:0xac09c380df0b750f!8m2!3d40.4568!4d-79.932492). You can also get a bus card from a machine at the airport. It is close to the exit where the bus '28X' leaves.

### Getting from the airport to the city

Bus: It is called '28X' and its stop is found by following the 'Ground Transportation' signs. You pay $2.75 in cash when you enter the bus and there is no change. If you want to go to the Shadyside Inn, you should get off the 28X about one hour into the bus ride at the crossing of Fifth Avenue and South Aiken Avenue.  If you need to change buses to get to your hotel, you will have to pay $2.75 again on entering.

The 'Ground Transportation' signs also lead you to taxis, Ubers and Lyfts. Uber and Lyft work well in Pittsburgh. You need a smartphone to use the latter two.

A more convenient way which is likely to be cheaper than uber/lyft/taxis is the 'Super Shuttle'. There is a counter for it in the terminal and it is payable by credit card. A shuttle bus will drive you and others directly to your destinations in Pittsburgh. You might have to wait a bit, maybe even a long time. You do not need a smartphone or app to use it.
