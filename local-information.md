### Travel from the Airport

The cheapest way to get to Pittsburgh from the airport is the [28x bus
line](https://www.portauthority.org/pdfs/28X.pdf), which stops close to the CMU
Campus (Stop MOREWOOD AVE AT FORBES AVE FS) and the Shadyside Inn (Stop
FIFTH AVE OPP AIKEN AVE). 

There is also the possibility to book a
[SuperShuttle](https://www.supershuttle.com/locations/pittsburgh-pit/) in
advance for around $40, which is a shared shuttle that can drop you off directly
at your accommodation.

Finally, the ride sharing services **Lyft** and **Uber** operate in Pittsburgh,
with prices for trips from the airport starting at around $40 and varying
throughout the day.

### Getting around in Pittsburgh

There are public busses in Pittsburgh, the fare is paid on entering the bus and
is $2.75 to be payed in cash (there is no change). If you need to change the bus
to get somewhere, you have to pay again. It is possible to get a bus card and
load it using a credit card at bus stations (â‰  bus stop). A bus station in
Shadyside is [Negley
station](https://www.google.de/maps/place/East+Busway+at+Negley+Station+D/@40.4539493,-79.9350931,16.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8834f212ef940167:0xac09c380df0b750f!8m2!3d40.4568!4d-79.932492).
You can also get a bus card from a machine at the airport. It is close to the
exit where the bus '28X' leaves.

Uber and Lyft are also good options to get around.
