### Venue

The summer school will take place in the **Giant Eagle Auditorium**, room number
A51 in CMU's **Baker Hall** building (see [conference
map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Eq3-6x6P75jL6tUcY7eDLOuoL2-7NbHc&usp=sharing)).

We will start off Wednesday (August 7) morning with coffee at 8:45 AM in front
of the lecture hall, the first course fill begin at 9:15. The following days
courses will start at 9.

### Schedule

### Prerequisites

Familiarity with basic ideas and concepts of homotopy type theory will be
helpful for all courses. We recommend that beginners have a look at the first
sections of Egbert Rijke's [course notes](/images/hott-intro-rijke.pdf)
and/or the [HoTT
book](https://hott.github.io/book/nightly/hott-online-1212-g0d25f68.pdf).

For the formalization classes you will need to have the appropriate versions of
the Agda and Coq proof assistants installed (or use an online version in case of
Coq), see the course descriptions below for more details.

### Abstracts

#### Synthetic homotopy theory -- Egbert Rijke

[Course notes](/images/hott-intro-rijke.pdf).

#### Semantics of type theory -- Jonas Frey

#### Cubical methods -- Anders Mörtberg

Cubical methods have played an important role in the development of HoTT during
the last few years. The original motivation for considering these methods was to
give constructive justifications to HoTT, in particular to the univalence axiom.
These developments have also led to other major advances in the field, including
proof assistants with native support for computational univalence, semantics and
a syntactic schema for HITs, canonicity results, and a variety of independence
results. This course will give an introduction to these methods, both from a
syntactic perspective in the form of cubical type theory and from a semantic
perspective in the form of cubical set models.

#### Higher topos theory -- Mathieu Anel

#### Formalization in Agda -- Guillaume Brunerie

This course is an introduction to the Agda proof assistant. I will show you the
[main features of Agda, how to develop proofs interactively with it, and how to
use it for formalization of mathematics and of homotopy type theory. There will
also be various practical exercises.

In order to try Agda for yourself while following the course (highly
recommended), you will need a laptop with Agda version 2.6.0.1 (or newer) and
Emacs (a text editor used by Agda for editing proofs interactively). See the
installation instructions
[here](https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2019/agda-installation/) or
[here](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/getting-started/installation.html).

#### Formalization in Coq -- Kristina Sojakova

This course will focus on using the HoTT version of the Coq proof assistant to
formalize arguments from homotopy type theory. We will go over a few simpler
examples to illustrate the basic techniques and use of the library. The students
will then have the option to pursue more challenging exercises on their own
and/or contribute to the formalization of the HoTT book.
