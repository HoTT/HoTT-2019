#### Ilyas Khan

Ilyas Khan supports a number of scientific initiatives in mathematics and
quantum physics. He has supported the establishment of open-access academic
journals that help researchers and academicians to break free of the
anachronistic and corrupt practices of existing academic publishing companies
whilst maintaining the highest of academic and professional standards and
practices of peer review. He also provides philanthropic support to academic
conferences and workshops, university maths and theoretical physics departments
and independent research initiatives. All support is made free of any
constraints or demands.
